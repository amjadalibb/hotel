## Overview

Create, Check and Delete booking in website


### Pre-req: This code uses JRE 1.8, so please upgrade to JRE1.8 before running the test

If you are using eclipse following will be needed

In the project build path configuration dialog, under the libraries tab, you can delete the entry for "JRE System Library", click on "Add Library" and choose the installed JRE to compile with. Some compilers can be configured to compile at a back-level compiler version. I think that's why you're seeing the addition version options.
